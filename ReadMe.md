To obtain clean data set for the mean values from source the run_analysis.R file in chosen directory.  The script will download and unzip the file if the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder is not present in the working directory.

The function will generate no output but will create a object TTfin containing only the values associated with either mean or standard deviation.  It will then generate another object fin containing averages of each observation type over each activity.
